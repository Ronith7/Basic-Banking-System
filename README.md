A Simple Dynamic Basic Bank Management System
Frontend - HTML, CSS , JS
Backend - PHP
Database - MySQL
Created a dummy database for 10 customers. Customer table has basic fields such as Name, Email, Address and Current Balance. Transfer table records all transfers that happened.

When the user clicks on the "View Customers" button on the home page, the users which have been entered in the database are displayed. The user clicks on the "Send" option, and a window is displayed where the user can choose the receiver and then enter the amount to be transferred. And when the user clicks on submit, the transaction can view the transaction history.

The amount which is entered, is added to the receiver's current balance and subtracted from the sender's balance.
